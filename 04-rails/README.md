# About This Directory
This directory contains learning files and projects relating to Rails. This folder contains the following learning files:

- Rails setup and installation.
- Creating your first Rails project.
- Installing Gems and helpful Gems for the development process.
- Creating models.
- Model validations.
- Model callbacks and methods.
- Model relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)

## Important Note about Folder Organization:
*Note: Learning files are all `.md` files, and are numbered, starting with `01-rails-setup.md`.*

All un-numbered project folders are various Rails projects used throughout the learning lessons. If you read any of the `.md` files, you may see that in some learning lessons we are to build a Rails project and then practice our new skills upon it. Thus, all of the Rails projects contained herein belong to various learning lessons, and are best utilized when reading the projects accompanying `.md`. (Seemed like a lot of words--but the jist is, if you're looking into those folders and getting confused--revert back to reading the `.md` files, in which all projects are explained).
