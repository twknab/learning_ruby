# About

To begin working with Ruby, first install Vagrant, which is a virtual machine framework to level the development world in regards to operating system variance. Once Vagrant is installed, install VirtualBox, which we'll use to run Vagrant.

- Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

Download and install both files. See `first_vagrant_box` directory for our first use of these applications.

## Useful Commands

`vagrant init` = init a vagrant virtual machine
`vagrant box list` = list any vagrant boxes
